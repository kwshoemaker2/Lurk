* Create a Command class (or even a struct) for InputConverter instead of having three dictionaries

* Make the ClientSocket private, since no one should need to access it

* Have the closing of the ClientSocket be handled by the Globals class

* End the game upon receiving NOTIF Death

* Redesign some of the interaction between the GameWindow and LurkGame classes

* Redesign how the user logs in to the server and creates a new character

* Have the entire process for receiving data be handled by the Globals class (instead of being in two function calls in LurkGame.ReceiveMessages)

* Server seems to be sending a message when a new player enters the room that doesn't have a header. Change the DataParser to handle this case
