# Lurk
Client application developed for my Spring 2015 Computer Networking class

Implements the client side of a multiplayer text-based game. More details about the protocol used are found <a href="http://isoptera.lcsc.edu/~seth/cs435/lurk_protocol.html">here</a>

The second project will involve creating a server to service multiple Lurk clients that also implements the Lurk protocol

Game can currently be played by connecting to isoptera.lcsc.edu on port 5000

The current version of the client is buggy and will be updated at a later time
